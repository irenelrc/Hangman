Hangman Game in C
This is a school project of CS136 in University of Waterloo. It mainly designed to play Hangman Game YAY!

Play it with the following steps:
1. Enter a number between 1 and 1000 and it will pass you a word like ******** (if the word is waterloo)
2. Guess and enter a letter (upper-case works same with lower-case)
3. If you suggest a letter which occurs in the word, it will show the letter in all its correct positions, like ***e***** (if you enter e) and go back to step 2
4. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, it will remain the same ***e***** (if you enter g) and draws one element of a hanged man.
5. If you guess over six times, and game is over and you can choose to start over (back to 1), or exit.
6. If you attempt to guess the whole word, then CONGRATULATIONS! You win the game! And of course, you can choose to start over (back to 1) or exit.

Have fun! :)
